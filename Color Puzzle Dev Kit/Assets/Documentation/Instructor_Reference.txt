Concept Breakdown
Target Concept: Color Puzzle by Jack McPherson
Art - Pixel
Genre - Top Down Puzzle Maze
Narrative - Open to the designer, possible maze-escape themes
Summary: A simple puzzle maze game in which the player character needs to unlock colored doors 
by collecting the corresponding color, which changes the player’s color and allows them to 
pass through that door.

Required Features:
Swap Tiles
    -Store a reference to a color
    -Change the player’s sprite renderer color to match the tile color
Door
    -Store reference to a color
    -Deny access if a player’s color doesn't match a door’s
    -One door is the “exit” door
Player
    -Movement
    -Interaction with doors and swap tiles

Optional Features:
    Possibly implement a way to change the color of a swap tile
    Implementation of a way to ‘find’ colors that could be applied to swap tiles found elsewhere
    Adjusting the size and complexity of each puzzle by implementing many different colors into a single level

Assets:
    World: Pixel Tileset
    Playe: Pixel Sprite
    Swap Tiles/UI: Pixel Icon Set
    UI: Inventory Slot Grid
    Sound

Programming Breakdown

Script Behaviors:
Swap Tile
    Stores a color reference and a sprite representing the color
    Player interaction instantiates a new tile to appear for the player to collect
        -Plays a sound on instantiation
        -Show text to indicate the swap

Player Controller
    2D Top Down Movement
    Input for interacting with the “Swap Tiles”
    Door Collisions
    Wall Collisions

Door
    Store a reference to a color, and sprite renderer
    Doesn’t allow the player to pass through its collider if the player is the wrong color
        -Displays text to show the error to players
        -Play sounds for incorrect/correct colors used
    Destroy Itself after the player has unlocked it
    If this door is the exit door, end the level
        -The exit door should display a unique icon to differentiate it from other doors

Color “Inventory”
    A visual indicator of the current color tile that the player has implemented
    Swaps itself with new colors when the player interacts with a new tile
    Toggle the button to hide/show
    Possible separate Inventory of colors used/collected for the level

Exposed Variables:
    Swap Tile Color
    Swap Tile Sprite
    Player Speed
    Player Color
    Door Color
    Exit Door Boolean
    Current Tile (Player)
    Current Tile (Inventory)
    Inventory Toggle

Editor Modifiers:
Swap Tile
    An array of swap tiles in a Level that can be dragged into the editor from the hierarchy
    Ability to change the color of the swap tile from the editor
    Ability to change the sprite of the swap tile from the editor

Player
    Change player speed from the editor
    Change the current color of the player from the editor

Door
    An array of doors in a level can be dragged into the editor from the hierarchy
    Ability to change the color of the door from the editor
    Ability to change the sprite of the door from the editor
    Ability to toggle which door is the exit door from the editor

Color Inventory
    Ability to change the current color inside the slot
    Ability to clear the color inside the slot
    Ability to toggle the inventory from the hierarchy
